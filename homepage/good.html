			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img class="myPhoto" src="myPhoto1.jpg" alt="myPhoto1"/>
			<p>My name is Dylan Alcock; I'm currently a student at the University of Alberta majoring in Computer Science. I have had the opportunity to specialize in areas including file and database management, software engineering, UNIX and scripting, GPU programming, and general programming. These include Python, C, C++, Java, Git, and web applications. This has exposed me to a number of situations where an obstacle needed to be overcome in a timely manner, which has evolved my set of skills and led to my academic success. I have worked on a project in CMPUT 291 with a team of individuals to create a localized version of twitter with thousands of data inputs, this helped enforce strong interpersonal skills, hard work, time efficiency, identifying opportunities, and the ability to work independently in finding solutions are all characteristics I feel that I understand successfully.
			</p>
			<p>Being involved in competitive sports, since I was young, has exposed me to the high level of teamwork and determination, which have been major factors on my personal ambition. It has given me the drive to experience all that life can offer. Taking risks and proving my ability to grow as a person. This current opportunity is no exception, working both as an opportunity to expand my own knowledge and learn how working in the industry differs from the classroom.</p>

			<h2>What I Can Do For Potential Employers</h2>
			<p> I am in my fifth year of a BSc degree with a major in computer science. I would be a great asset to your team with my personal ambitions and skill set. It is not all about the knowledge and experience you possess when you begin, but also the personality you bring with you. You will not find another applicant with as positive of attitude, nor with as much drive to succeed.</p>
			<p>Throughout my schooling I have taken a variety of courses that have introduced me to many problems. Giving me the ability to solve any problem that a potential employer can throw at me.</p>
